# Kidney-Stone-Detection-
 # Kidney Stone Detection using Image Processing  This project uses OpenCV and image processing techniques to detect potential kidney stones in medical images. The detection algorithm identifies circular structures in grayscale images, calculates their mean intensity and standard deviation, and assigns a confidence score to each potential kidney stone.  ## Table of Contents 1.

It uses the Hough Circle Transform to identify circular shapes that might indicate kidney stones, and it calculates a confidence score based on intensity analysis.  ## Installation  ### Prerequisites - Python 3.x - [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  ### Dependencies To install the required dependencies, run the following:  ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt
